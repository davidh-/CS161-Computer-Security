a) A description of the procedure you used to obtain the secret:
	First step was the create a fake certificate using the Ditipwntar files with our own private key. Then 
	we needed to write pcap_tool to intercept the governor's DNS request and use it to form a malicious response.
	The response we send points him at our local server, which does the rest of the work in stealing his password.

b) A discussion of whether there are any mechanisms or protocols Governor could
have used to defend himself against your attack. If so, explain why your attack
wouldnâ€™t work when using these. If not, discuss the implications of this attack
for the use of TLS in the Internet today:
	The only thing I he could do is know the IP before hand or circumvent DNS somehow. Otherwise, No.
	If we can produce bad certificates and man in the middle attack his wireless connection, he's hosed.
	This emphasizes the importance of securing your local network, as well as having CA's we can trust.
