a) A description of the procedure you used to obtain the secret:
	Attack without rewrite_cn: We noticed the parser looked for a / to indicate the end of the CN, and the CA would sign
		a cert that contained that after the real site's CN as long as it ended with .neocal.info. So we created a CSR 
		take advantage of this. All that was left to see the secret was have rewriter.py print the html request.
	Attack with rewrite_cn: strcmp ends if it hits a null terminator. So we used the same idea as above but used
		the rewrite script to insert a null terminator into the CN.

b) A discussion of what, if anything, gov-of-caltopia.info can do to protect
against these attacks:
	Use a different CA.

c) A discussion of what, if anything, Governor can do to protect against these
attacks:
	Re-write the client code to properly check the CN of the certificate before accepting it. Or just use someone
		elses code.

d) A discussion of what, if anything, budget-certs-r-us.biz can do to protect
against these attacks:
	Do some kind of sanity check before signing certificates.
