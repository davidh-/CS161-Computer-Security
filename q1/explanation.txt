The first step was finding the IP and available ports for the Governor’s server. To do this, we did an nmap scan of the local network.
We found the server and an open ftp port. After logging in, we discovered that the server was running vsFTPd 2.3.4.
There’s a known backdoor for this version in which you provide a username containing ‘:)’. Upon receiving the username and any password,
a tcp callback shell is attempted on port 6200. So we open up another shell and use tcp to connect to the server at port 6200.
The connection opens a shell with access to secret.txt.
