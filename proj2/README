For the full documentation of the code provided, please see the online
documentation at https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/fa16/projects/2/docs/

As always, if you have questions about or find errors in this documentation,
please post on Piazza.

For this project, you can work in teams of up to 2 people.

All of your code must go in `client.py`.

You must use Python 3 and PyCrypto 2.6.1 for this project. These are already
provided for you on Hive and most other instructional machines. Double check
that you are using Python3---on many machines (including Hive), the `python`
command defaults to Python 2. Use the `python3` command. For more details see
the `Getting Started` section in the online documentation.
